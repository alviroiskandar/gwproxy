# --bind-iface: the global default egress interface for outgoing (target)
# connections, and how an ACL "-j BIND" rule overrides it.
#
# SO_BINDTODEVICE itself has been unprivileged since Linux 5.7, but to be worth
# asserting on it needs a second path to the origin: a veth pair with one end in
# a separate network namespace, the origin server inside that namespace, and two
# addresses on our end. That makes the assertions sharp. Binding the wrong
# device leaves the origin unreachable, so "the connection was dropped" really
# does mean the device was honoured, and our end's second address is one the
# kernel would never pick by itself.
#
# There are two ways to build that network, and this test takes whichever the
# host allows:
#
#   * unprivileged, inside a private user+network namespace, where we hold
#     CAP_NET_ADMIN over our own netns. The peer namespace is a parked
#     "unshare -n" helper addressed by pid rather than an "ip netns" entry,
#     because that would want CAP_SYS_ADMIN to mount under /run/netns. Nothing
#     outside the namespace is touched, so the test network cannot collide with
#     the host's addresses or be rewritten by its NAT rules;
#
#   * privileged, on the host with "ip netns", when user namespaces are not
#     available. Ubuntu 24.04 restricts unprivileged ones by default
#     (kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns), and the GitHub runners
#     have them off -- 0063 skips there for exactly this reason. Without this
#     fallback the whole test would skip on the one machine that runs it most.
#
# Only when neither works does it skip.
#
# Covered, on every event loop:
#   * --bind-iface alone: the right device carries traffic, the wrong one (lo)
#     is fatal rather than silently egressing via the default route;
#   * --bind-iface together with --bind-source;
#   * an ACL "-j BIND --to-iface" rule overriding a global default that would
#     otherwise drop the connection, and REPLACING it wholesale -- a rule that
#     names only an interface must not inherit the global --bind-source;
#   * a nonexistent global device: gwproxy still starts (the device may come up
#     later, e.g. a WireGuard link) but every connection is dropped.
