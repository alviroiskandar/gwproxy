# Upstream SOCKS5 chaining (--upstream-proxy): a front SOCKS5 proxy routes
# every outgoing connection through a second (upstream) SOCKS5 proxy. Verify a
# payload survives the whole chain byte-for-byte for both URL schemes --
# socks5:// (the front resolves the target) and socks5h:// (the upstream
# resolves it) -- across every available front-end event loop.
#
# The destination must be a NAME for the two schemes to differ at all: with an
# IP literal there is nothing to resolve, both schemes emit the same ATYP=1
# request, and the socks5h path is never exercised. A recording upstream then
# pins the actual distinction, since both schemes otherwise produce an equally
# working transfer.
