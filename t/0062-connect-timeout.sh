# --connect-timeout: when the target never completes the TCP handshake, the
# proxy must give up after the timeout and release the connection -- closing
# the client and reclaiming both descriptors. Asserting only that a timeout is
# logged is not enough: an event loop can log it and still hold the pair
# forever, which leaks two fds per attempt and is remotely triggerable. So this
# checks the client-visible outcome (the proxy closes us) and that the
# descriptor count returns to its baseline. Exercised on every available loop.
#
# It also checks that the client is told WHY, in whichever protocol it speaks:
# SOCKS5 REP 0x06 (TTL expired) or HTTP 504. The protocol-handshake timeout
# shares this timer but must stay silent -- the client has not asked for
# anything yet, so there is nothing to answer.
