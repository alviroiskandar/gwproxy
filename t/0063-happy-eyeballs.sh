# Multi-address targets (RFC 8305). A name that resolves to several addresses
# must not be hostage to the first one:
#
#   (a) fallback -- when the first address actively fails (refused), the next
#       is tried and the transfer still succeeds;
#   (b) racing   -- when the first address is black-holed (SYNs dropped, so it
#       never reports anything), the next joins the race after the Connection
#       Attempt Delay. Without racing this case costs the entire
#       --connect-timeout, so the assertion is on elapsed time, not just
#       success: a passing run must beat the timeout by a wide margin.
#
# Controlling which addresses a name has means controlling /etc/hosts, so the
# body runs inside a private user+mount namespace with a hosts file bind-mounted
# over the real one. Nothing outside the namespace is touched.
