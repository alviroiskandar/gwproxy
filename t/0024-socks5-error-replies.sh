# SOCKS5 error replies (RFC 1928 Section 6): the proxy must answer a request it
# cannot satisfy with a reply carrying the matching REP code, not just hang up.
# A client that gets a bare FIN cannot tell "the target refused" from "the proxy
# died", and curl reports both identically -- so these need a raw client that
# reads the reply byte.
#
# Covered: a refused target (REP 0x05), an unsupported command (REP 0x07), and
# a successful CONNECT as the control. Exercised on every available event loop.
