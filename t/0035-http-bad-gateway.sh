# HTTP 502: when the origin cannot be reached the proxy must answer, not just
# hang up. A bare FIN leaves the client reporting a transport error it cannot
# explain, and is indistinguishable from the proxy crashing. RFC 9110 s15.6.3
# calls for 502 Bad Gateway.
#
# Covered on every available event loop: a refused target in forward mode and
# through CONNECT, and a name that does not resolve. A successful fetch is the
# control, so a proxy answering 502 to everything could not pass.
