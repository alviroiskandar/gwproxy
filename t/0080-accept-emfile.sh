# Accept-time fd exhaustion (EMFILE) recovery, for both event loops.
#
# A low RLIMIT_NOFILE is imposed on the proxy (via ulimit, which needs no
# privilege), then it is flooded with held-open connections until accept() hits
# EMFILE. The worker must PAUSE accepting rather than die; once the flood is
# released and descriptors free up, it must resume serving new connections.
# ENFILE is handled by the very same path, so exercising EMFILE covers it too.
