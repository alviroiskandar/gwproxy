# Shared "leave no gwproxy behind" sweep, sourced by t/lib.sh (so a test cleans
# up after itself) and t/run-one.sh (so the runner cleans up after a test that
# could not clean up after itself -- a SIGKILLed test never runs its EXIT trap,
# and its proxies are reparented to init and linger forever).
#
# MATCHING RULE: a process is only ever killed when /proc/<pid>/exe resolves to
# the gwproxy binary itself. Never match on the process name or command line:
# editors, shells, agent sessions and this very script routinely carry the
# string "gwproxy" in their argv, and killing those would be destructive. A
# binary that has been rebuilt since the process started shows up as
# "<path> (deleted)", so that spelling is matched too.
#
# SCOPE: by default only processes in OUR OWN process group are killed, because
# `make -jN` runs tests concurrently and a global kill would shoot down the
# proxies of every other test in flight. run-one.sh puts each test in its own
# process group (setsid), and a process keeps its process group even after it
# is orphaned and reparented to init -- which is exactly the case this sweep
# exists for. Pass --all to ignore the group and sweep everything, for cleaning
# up by hand after an interrupted session.

# _gwp_pgid_of <pid>: print the process group id of <pid>, or nothing.
# Parses /proc/<pid>/stat after the comm field, which may itself contain spaces
# and parentheses, so split on the last ')'.

# gwp_kill_priv <pid>: stop a gwproxy that was started as `$SUDO gwproxy ... &`,
# where <pid> is the $! recorded at that point.
#
# The privileged tests cannot use gwp_sweep() for this. The proxy runs as root,
# so an unprivileged /proc/<pid>/exe readlink returns nothing at all and the
# process is invisible to the very matching rule above -- the scan has to run as
# root, which is what this wrapper adds.
#
# <pid> is sudo's, not necessarily the proxy's, and which of the two it is
# depends on configuration: with `Defaults use_pty` sudo stays resident and runs
# the proxy as its child in a process group of its own, and without it sudo
# execs the proxy in place, so the proxy IS <pid>. Killing <pid> alone therefore
# reaches the proxy only in the second case, which is why this walks the process
# tree and stops every gwproxy that is <pid> or descends from it.
#
# That ancestry test is also what scopes the kill to THIS test, the job the
# process group does in gwp_sweep(). The group is unusable here precisely
# because sudo may have moved the proxy into one of its own, so under `make -jN`
# a group- or name-based kill could take out a concurrent test's proxy.
