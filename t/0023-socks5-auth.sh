# SOCKS5 username/password authentication (RFC1929): a proxy started with a
# --socks5-auth-file must (a) accept a client that presents the correct
# username/password and relay the payload byte-exact, (b) reject a client
# with a wrong password, and (c) reject a client that presents no
# credentials at all. Exercised on every available event loop.
