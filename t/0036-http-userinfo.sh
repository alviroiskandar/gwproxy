# Userinfo in an absolute-form request target (RFC 3986 Section 3.2): the
# userinfo runs to the LAST '@' and is not part of the host. Getting this wrong
# is not just a parsing nicety -- scanning for the port separator before
# dropping the userinfo splits "A:B@C" on the colon INSIDE the userinfo, so the
# proxy connects to the attacker-chosen "A" while the authority still reads as
# "C" to anything inspecting the URL.
#
# Checked here:
#   (a) a URL carrying userinfo reaches the right origin, and the userinfo is
#       not leaked to it in the Host header;
#   (b) "REAL:PORT@decoy" resolves to the decoy -- the authority -- not to the
#       host hidden in the userinfo. Asserted against the destination the proxy
#       actually asked its upstream for, because that is the observable that
#       the disguise attacks; a socks5h upstream is used since that path takes
#       the hostname straight from this parse.
