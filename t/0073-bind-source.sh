# --bind-source: the global default source address for outgoing (target)
# connections, and how an ACL "-j BIND" rule overrides it. Binding a source
# address that is already configured locally needs no privilege, so this test
# runs everywhere; the interface half of the feature (--bind-iface) needs a
# second path to the origin to be worth asserting on, so it needs root to build
# one and lives in 0074-bind-iface.sh.
#
# Every 127.0.0.0/8 address is local on Linux, so 127.0.0.2 and friends are
# bindable sources that the origin can tell apart from the 127.0.0.1 the kernel
# would have picked. t/servers/peer_addr.py reports the source address it saw,
# which is what every assertion here is made of.
#
# Covered, on every event loop:
#   * --bind-source alone pins the source address, in both the "ip" and the
#     "ip:port" spelling;
#   * an ACL "-j BIND --to-source" rule wins over the global default;
#   * a global source of the wrong address family is SKIPPED, not fatal: an
#     IPv4 --bind-source must not break IPv6 targets on a dual-stack proxy;
#   * the same mismatch in an explicit ACL rule stays strict (dropped), which
#     is the asymmetry the option is documented to have;
#   * a malformed --bind-source / --bind-iface is refused at startup, rather
#     than turning into every connection quietly failing later.
