# SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE (RFC 1928): a client opens a TCP control connection,
# issues UDP ASSOCIATE, and the proxy returns a bound UDP relay endpoint. The
# client then sends SOCKS5-wrapped datagrams to that relay, which forwards them
# to a UDP echo server and relays the replies back. Verify datagrams of several
# sizes round-trip byte-exact, IPv4/IPv6 and cross-address-family targets all
# relay (the relay socket is dual-stack), the relay is torn down with its TCP
# control connection, and plain SOCKS5 CONNECT still works on the same port. The
# relay is exercised on both event loops (epoll and, when built, io_uring).
# The datagrams the relay must REFUSE are asserted too: a wrong source address
# (RFC 1928), a fragmented datagram, and a domain-name target.
