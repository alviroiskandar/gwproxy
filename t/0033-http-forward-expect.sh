# Forwarding HTTP proxy + "Expect: 100-continue" (RFC 9110 Section 10.1.1).
# The proxy forwards the expectation to the origin, so:
#   (a) an authenticated POST is forwarded and its body is relayed (the origin
#       drives the 100 Continue), and
#   (b) a POST that fails proxy authentication is rejected with 407 *before* the
#       origin is contacted, so the body is never sent upstream (no wasted
#       round-trip). The origin logs one line per request it receives, so the
#       test can confirm a rejected request left nothing behind.
