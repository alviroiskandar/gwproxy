#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ====================
# The workflow does not test just the pushed tip, it tests every commit in
# the pushed range: the get_commit_list job expands the range into a matrix
# axis and every job then runs "git checkout <commit>" before building.
#
# GitHub Actions, however, always reads the workflow YAML from the newest
# commit. Any build command written directly into the YAML is therefore
# applied to older commits that were never written for it -- a new configure
# flag, a new dependency, a new compiler pin -- and CI breaks retroactively
# on commits that were perfectly fine when they were written.
#
# Keeping the commands here fixes that: this script is checked out together
# with the commit under test, so every commit is built with exactly the
# commands it shipped with. Only the matrix stays in the YAML, and its values
# are handed to this script as arguments.
#
# CONSEQUENCE FOR EDITORS OF THIS FILE
# ====================================
# Older commits run their own older copy of this file. Never assume the
# caller and the script agree: validate every argument, and fail loudly
# rather than silently skipping a build.
#
# Adding a build variant should mean editing this file only.

Usage: ${PROG} <command> [options]

Runs the gwproxy CI steps. The workflow passes its matrix values in as
options; everything else (build variants, configure flags, package lists)
lives in this script so that it travels with the commit under test.

Commands:
  deps             Install the toolchain for one Ubuntu build matrix row.
                   Requires --arch, --cc, --cc-pkg.
  build            Run every build variant for one Ubuntu build matrix row.
                   Requires --arch, --cc, --sanitize.
  alpine-deps      Install the Alpine/musl build dependencies (needs root).
  alpine-build     Run every build variant for the Alpine/musl job.
  codespell-deps   Install codespell.
  codespell        Run codespell over man/.

Options:
  --arch=ARCH      Target architecture of the row, e.g. x86_64, mips.
                   Tests are only run when this is x86_64; every other row
                   is cross-compiled and its binaries cannot be executed.
  --cc=CC          C compiler to build with, e.g. mips-linux-gnu-gcc.
  --cc-pkg=PKG     Debian package providing --cc, or the literal "clang"
                   to install clang-${CLANG_VERSION} from apt.llvm.org.
  --sanitize=0|1   Whether this row is the AddressSanitizer/UBSan row.
  -h, --help       Print this message.

Environment:
  JOBS=N           Parallelism for make (default: nproc).
  DRY_RUN=1        Print the commands instead of running them.
